  p The characters wake up, locked in a dark cave, lit only by glowing lichen. They are surrounded by a group of misfits of different races, some they did not know existed:
    ul
      li Buppido, calm and enthusiastic derro
      li Prince Derendil, Body of a Quaggoth, mind of an elf. Was an elf, cursed by an evil wizard.
      li Eldeth, warrior lady dwarf, loyal and brave
      li Jimjar, witty deep gnome
      li Ront, Orc bully, scared of the drow
      li Sarith, Drow, accused of murder, not quite stable &mdash; but he's a drow, who knows what they're like usually
      li Shuushar the awakened, Pacifist Kuo-Toa
      li Stool, Curious and friendly Myconid
      li Topsy and Turvy, deep gnome twins
  p After some time, getting to know their fellow inmates and understanding their fate, the characters start looking for a way to get out.
    | Attempts to rile up the fellow inmates into an uprising have mitigated results. Buppido, Derendil, Eldeth and Sarith seem willing to take the risk.
    | On the other hand, Ront is terrified of repercussions, and Jimjar seems to think the odds are impossible: the inmates are too unreliable to plan anything solid.
    | Shuushar and Stool seem on the fence, willing to leave, but uncommitted to facing the drow.
    | Topsy and Turvy have not voiced their opinion on the question.
